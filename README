This is a simple script to map a Mediawiki instance.

There's quite a lot of custom stuff for Grid'5000 built-in.

Usage:
======
1. Create a tunnel to your MySQL instance (if needed): ssh -L 3306:localhost:3306 g5kadmin@web.g5k

2. Edit the script and configure it
3. Run it with: ./mapper > links
4. Generate pdf with: dot -T pdf -o dot.pdf links

or 3+4 in one go: ./mapper | dot -Tpdf -o dot.pdf

Additional files:
=================
* dont-look-further.in: list of pages that are linked to, but that should be considered "dead ends" while exploring.
Typically, they are pages that are only kept for historical purposes. They are displayed in orange in the graph.
* must-not-be-reached.in: list of pages that should not be reached (deprecated pages, internal pages, for example). They trigger a warning at execution, and are displayed in red in the graph.
* must-not-be-reached-overrides.in: pairs of pages (from, to) where "to" is part of must-not-be-reached, but where the link should not trigger a warning.
* not-portal-user-but-ok.in: by default, pages that are not part of the users portal (not public), but are reached, raise a warning. This file lists pages where the warning should not be displayed.
